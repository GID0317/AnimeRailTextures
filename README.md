### ℹ️ the game have many unammed textures, with only a number, which creates messy as hell folders in some places, a rework should be made at some point to rearrange everything correctly

### ℹ️ Starting at version 2.1, the mapping method was changed which made the coverage go from 7% to 98%. This means most textures are now in the `asbres` folder and organized as the game intended them to be. The few still unmapped files are in their respective folder. 

### In addition to that, you can download [on the anime links page](https://github.com/umaichanuwu/AnimeLinks/blob/main/README.md) the mapping file which will help you greatly into searching something specific. It's a JSON file in the form `{"filename": "filepath"}`.
